            <p class="description"> In 2006, Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti finished writing the book, "House".
                The authors have sold millions of copies of this thrilling novel that gives you a new appreciation for the term "haunting".
                When two unssuspecting couples are semmingly brought to a mysterious house of supernatural horror and events.
                Trapped by an unknown force inside the home, they are thrown into battling the beings among them, and each other in a 
                terrifying and unbelivable turn of events.

            <article class="thought">
                <p class="booktakeaway"> This book touches on modern day problems with a scary but fulfilling end.
                    The characters in the book have to realize what issues they have within themselves to beat the house, and the demons that haunt it.

            </article>
            <article class="thought">
                <p class="booktakeaway">The House changes itself based on each character in the book which I found very interesting.
                    The characters must each fight their own version of the house while at the same time being in each others reality.
                They show perseverance and toughness as each encounter with the beasts within get continuosly harder.  </p>
