      <article class="colin-review">This is one of my favorite books, and my most frequently recommended book when people tell me they would like to get back into reading.<br>
      It is a short novel at only 127 pages, and easily digestable with points to think on long after one has finished reading it. I enjoy the symbolism of Santiago's age being <br>
      both a benefit and hinderance to his pursuit of the marlin- his aging body makes the physical strains more difficult but his wisdom and experience help him. <br>
      To me, it is his last act of youth.</article>
